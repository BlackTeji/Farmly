                <p class="lead">
                    We grew up eating from the land. Yam from the ridges, fish from the stream, oil from the press
                    behind the house. Mothers cooked what the season brought. Fathers brought home the harvest. And
                    neighbors? They shared, always.

                    At Farmly, we‚Äôre bringing that life back. We plant with patience and harvest with care. What the
                    earth gives, we carry gently to the homes that need it.

                    We deliver the kind of food that makes you give thanks and share with your community. Food that
                    remembers where it came from, and knows exactly where it‚Äôs going: your home.

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    We watched food rot in the village, good food, while markets in the city sold it for too much.
                    So we started small. A few tubers of yam. Some bags of garri. Oil from the mill. Plantain from the
                    backyard. Dried fish wrapped in brown paper.

                    Slowly, the idea took root: what if we just carried the food ourselves, from the farms that grow
                    it, straight to the homes that need it?

                    It began with one delivery to Lagos. Now, it‚Äôs a steady flow of harvests. The farm gives, and we
                    carry. From our farm to your family.
