                <h2>How often do you deliver?</h2>
                <p>
                    We deliver to Lagos <strong>twice a month</strong> — on the
                    <strong>second</strong> and <strong>last Saturdays</strong> of each month.  Place your order during one of the open windows and we'll include you in the upcoming batch.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Order windows open 14 days before each delivery date and close 48 hours before delivery. For example, for a delivery on Saturday the 14th, the order window opens on the 1st and closes on the 12th at midnight.
                </p>

                    batch orders so your produce arrives fresh and cost-effectively.</p>
